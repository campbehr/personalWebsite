            Thanks for stopping by my page! If you'd like to learn less of me as
            a person, than feel free to scroll to the next session titled,
            Portfolio. Otherwise, my hopes are that through navigating this site
            in its entirety, you will have a nice snapshot of who I am, and my
            overall ability as a web developer. Onto a little bit about myslef

            I consider myself a very reserved person who loves a lively room.
            When I have free time, I love to go on adventures with my finaceÂ´
            and crazy pup, Maverick. I tell him all the time that one day we'll
            get him a Goose, but I don't think he believes me anymore. Other
            things I love are endurance races and most other sports related
            activities. My favorite movies (becuase I can't just pick one) are
            <i>Hidalgo, Star Wars,</i> and <i>A Knight's Tale</i>. When working,
            I like to listen to Led Zepplin or Cream, and when I find time, I
            love to read series novels from Tolkein to Rowling and from Martin
            to Pierce Brown... not to be confused with the other Brown. Other
            than that, I consider myself a life long learner and love to find
            the detail in the devils.
