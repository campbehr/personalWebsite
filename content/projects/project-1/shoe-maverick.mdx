This app was built using the create-react-app along with several other libraries such as Redux and react-router-dom. For the styling I used Styled-Components. I chose this stack because of the clean way Redux handles state management by breaking down individual parts and exporting one global state through a central reducer. In my opinion, Redux fits perfectly within the React ecosystem since it is essentially tearing down state handling functions into reusable components. The goal of this website was to give me a better understanding of what a business must think about when creating an online store.

Other than gaining a better understanding of Redux, I also learned how to set up user authentication through Google’s Firebase API. Within Firebase I utilized their authentication services as well as their Cloud Firestore services for storing new user information obtained at signup. Last but not least I learned how to handle payments through Stripe’s testing API at checkout.

Issues I ran into with this program were breaking down state handlers into smaller chunks to be used through reducers. I was able to work through this issue by reading the documentation and watching tutorials. I found that if I were to first build the state handler like a class component then I could more easily visualize the breakdown.
