This app was built using ReactJS on the client side with a small NodeJS server for the back end. It's objective is to act as an informational landing page and signup form for a small coalition of pilots who are moving to push the required retirement age of US airline pilots from 65 to 68.

To start the project I met with the group of pilots several times over zoom calls to get a better feel for what they needed. What we found were 2 requirements. First, it needed to be quick and simple to get their message to like minded inviduals. Second, it needed a way for individuals to sign up for more information. To do this we settled on setting up a Mailchimp account to handle their email campaigns along with members sign up. This choice was made due to mailchimps UI and simplicity. I then designed the mockups through Figma so that we could agree on the interface. Next for the website we chose React for the front end and Node for the back end. React was chosen for its use of hooks and components and Node for its speed and call handling abilities. The client side code is hosted on Netlify's CDN while the server side code is hosted on Heroku. For now this fits the needs of the organization as it is still in its fledgling stage and having no costs for servers is a big help until they get more backing.
