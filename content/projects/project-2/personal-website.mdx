I chose to build my personal website with Gatsby because of its ability to generate lean static files at build time. This is important because as I increase the size of my portfolio it will be more cost effective to serve up static pages. Other reasons include Gatsby’s ease of use with GraphQL and its tool, graphiql. These combined, make adding future material to the page very simple. My goal through having a personal website is to better showcase my portfolio and to obtain suggestions from the general public on how I can improve as a developer.

My main focus while building this application was to keep the file structure and code neat and clean to make for a better developer experience in the future. Other takeaways from this project were working with a schema for content and how to handle auto generation of pages when new content is added.

The major issues I ran into with this page were from more of a design aspect. My goal was to create a fluid landscape for the visitor with minimum wasted space. I wanted the navigation to feel more a part of the page than stuck at the top like an afterthought. I’m sure I could improve this but hope that it is a step in the right direction. As always I am open to suggestions.
