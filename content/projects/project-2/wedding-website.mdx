The main goal for this website was to be fast, to the point with its information and accessible across all screen sizes. Because of this, I chose to go with a static webpage and because of the React documentation’s recommendation, I decided to go with the Gatsby framework. For the styling of the web page I tried my hand at styled-components. This was my first build with both Gatsby and Styled-Components.

Due to Gatsby being a framework it relies heavily on plugins, which is very helpful in my opinion. The drawback to this is all of the documentation you need to read through in order to work with the plugins. Luckily the Gatsby community is very helpful and well documented. In large my greatest takeaway from this project was package management and a better sense of what should go into the planning stages of building a website.

Issues I ran into while building this site dealt mainly with package versions being out of sink and with the local routing component Gatsby uses for navigation. Working through the kinks in the plugin versions was a little time consuming but ultimately not hard to figure out due to Gatsby’s excellent documentation. The navigation component “Link” however still perplexes me. It works extremely well as a navigator, but in the documentation it claims to not be an <a/> tag, though if you open up the console and look at it through a browser it clearly is. This really didn't cause any issues for me but I can see that being an issue in other projects.
