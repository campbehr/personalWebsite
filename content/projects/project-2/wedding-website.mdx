The main goal for this website was to be fast, to the point and accessible across all screen sizes. Because of this, I chose to go with a static webpage and to the React documentationâ€™s recommendation, I decided to go with the Gatsby framework. For the styling of the web page I tried my hand at styled-components. This was my first build with both Gatsby and Styled-Components.

Due to Gatsby being a framework it relies heavily on plugins, which is very helpful when you need to build an application fast. The drawback to this is all of the documentation you need to read through in order to work with the plugins. Luckily the Gatsby community is very helpful and well documented. In large my greatest takeaway from this project was package management and a better sense of what should go into the planning stages of building a website.
